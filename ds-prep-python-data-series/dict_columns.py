# Write your code below this line:

# Get the last-appearing series point, as a dict with the column names as keys.


# Get the first five series points, in the order they appear, as a list of
# tuples.


# Check if the years 2000 and 2010 are each included in the data series.


# Get the unemployment rate for the most recent year.


# Get all the unique years included in the series, as a set.


# Get the list of the unemployment rates, ordered by year.


# Get the largest unemployment rate.


# Create a new series, in the same format as the original, with the
# "employment rate" instead of the "unemployment rate" (the rates are listed in
# percentages).


# Create a new series, in the same format as the original, but only containing
# the series points where the unemployment rate is at least 7.


# Create a dict containing the count of the number of times each unemployment
# rate appears in the series.
